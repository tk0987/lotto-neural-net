hello,

here we have a lotto 1d cnn-dense net, designed for checking whether lotto (polish game like powerball) is really stochastic.

made for fun and for knowledge, and for high energy bills.

the network has 49 parts - as there are 6 numbers drawn out of [1,...,49]. Kind of bayesian approach.

net is untested - previous one optimized to stable numbers, which didnt change (earned with them 3, then 3, then 4 and 3). maybe this one will be better.
